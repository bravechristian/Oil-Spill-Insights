# 🛢 Oil Spill Analysis: Corporate Accountability & Environmental Impact

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes oil spill data from NOSDRA to assess corporate responsibility, environmental impact, and remediation efforts. Using Jupyter Notebook and data analytics techniques, it uncovers trends, identifies responsible corporations, evaluates cleanup effectiveness, and highlights key pollutants. The insights aim to support environmental protection and policy-making.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze trends in oil spill incidents over time.
- Identify corporations responsible for spills.
- Evaluate remediation efforts and effectiveness.
- Highlight key pollutants and affected areas.
- Provide actionable insights for stakeholders.

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source:** NOSDRA (National Oil Spill Detection and Response Agency)
- **Contents:**
  - Companies responsible for oil spills
  - Number of spill incidents
  - Remediation efforts (started and completed)
  - Primary pollutants during spillage
  - Locations and timestamps of spills

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Notebook:** Jupyter
- **Libraries Used:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 📌 Key Findings
- **Rising Trend:** Oil spills have increased in certain regions over the years.
- **Corporate Responsibility:** A few corporations account for a significant percentage of spills.
- **Remediation Gaps:** Some spill sites remain unremediated, raising environmental concerns.
- **Pollutants:** Crude oil and chemical contaminants such as chromium(cr) dominate the spills, posing health risks.
